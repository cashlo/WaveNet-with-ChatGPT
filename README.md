# WaveNet with ChatGPT
 This is a WaveNet implementation created with ChatGPT, the following is what ChatGPT want to put in README, it may or may not actually work.
 Actual usage: 
```bash
docker build -t wavenet .
docker run -v %cd%:/app wavenet python train.py
```

## Introduction
WaveNet is a deep learning model that was introduced by DeepMind in the paper "WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio" [1]. It is a variant of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that is specifically designed for generating high-quality audio waveforms.

In this project, we have implemented WaveNet to generate audio samples that can be used in a variety of applications, such as speech synthesis and music generation.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following software:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4 or higher
- NumPy 1.19 or higher
- librosa 0.8 or higher

## Usage
To train the model, run the train.py script with the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can specify the following arguments to control the training process:

- `--batch_size`: The batch size to use for training
- `--epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model for
- `--learning_rate`: The learning rate to use for the optimizer
- `--data_dir`: The directory where the data is stored

To generate audio samples from the model, run the `infer.py` script with the following command:

```bash
python infer.py
```

You can specify the following arguments to control the inference process:

- `--batch_size`: The batch size to use for inference
- `--num_samples`: The number of audio samples to generate

## Data
The model is trained on a dataset of audio waveforms. The data can be in any format that is compatible with the WaveNet model. For example, the waveforms can be represented as NumPy arrays or TensorFlow tensors.

To train the model, you will need to prepare the data and split it into training and validation sets. You can use the `tf.data` API to create a dataset object that iterates over the data and applies any necessary preprocessing and augmentation.

## Training
To train the WaveNet model, you will need to specify a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function measures how well the model is performing and the optimizer adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

In this implementation, we are using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. You can customize these by modifying the `loss` and `optimizer` variables in the `train.py` script.

## Docker

You can use Docker to run the WaveNet project in a consistent and reproducible environment.

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
docker build -t wavenet .
```

To run the Docker image and start a Jupyter Notebook server, use the following command:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 8888:8888 wavenet jupyter lab
```

This will start a Jupyter Notebook server in the Docker container, and you can access it by going to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser.

You can also customize the Docker image and the `Dockerfile` to fit your specific project requirements, such as installing additional libraries, setting environment variables, or exposing ports for debugging.

## Model
The WaveNet model consists of a series of dilated convolutional layers that operate on the input waveform. Each layer has a kernel size of 3 and a dilation rate that increases exponentially, which allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the audio data.

The output of the model is a predicted waveform that is generated from the input waveform. The model is trained to minimize the MSE between the predicted waveform and the ground truth waveform.
