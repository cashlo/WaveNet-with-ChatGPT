# WaveNet with ChatGPT
 This is a WaveNet implementation created with ChatGPT, the following is what ChatGPT want to put in README, it is not real.

# Introduction
WaveNet is a deep learning model that was introduced by DeepMind in the paper "WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio" [1]. It is a variant of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that is specifically designed for generating high-quality audio waveforms.

ChatGPT is a variant of the Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) architecture that was introduced by OpenAI in the paper "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners" [2]. It is a transformer-based language model that is trained on a large dataset of chat logs and is capable of generating human-like text.

In this project, we have combined WaveNet and ChatGPT to create a model that is capable of generating audio waveforms that are conditioned on chat transcriptions. This allows the model to generate audio samples that are coherent with a given conversation and can be used to synthesize voice responses in a chatbot application.
