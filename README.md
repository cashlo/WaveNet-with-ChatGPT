# WaveNet with ChatGPT
 This is a WaveNet implementation created with ChatGPT, the following is what ChatGPT want to put in README, it is not real.

# Introduction
WaveNet is a deep learning model that was introduced by DeepMind in the paper "WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio" [1]. It is a variant of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that is specifically designed for generating high-quality audio waveforms.

ChatGPT is a variant of the Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) architecture that was introduced by OpenAI in the paper "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners" [2]. It is a transformer-based language model that is trained on a large dataset of chat logs and is capable of generating human-like text.

In this project, we have combined WaveNet and ChatGPT to create a model that is capable of generating audio waveforms that are conditioned on chat transcriptions. This allows the model to generate audio samples that are coherent with a given conversation and can be used to synthesize voice responses in a chatbot application.

# Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following software:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4 or higher
- NumPy 1.19 or higher
- librosa 0.8 or higher

# Usage
To train the model, run the train.py script with the following command:

```
python train.py
```

You can specify the following arguments to control the training process:

- `--batch_size`: The batch size to use for training
- `--epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model for
- `--learning_rate`: The learning rate to use for the optimizer
- `--data_dir`: The directory where the data is stored
To evaluate the model, run the `evaluate.py` script with the following command:

```
python evaluate.py
```

You can specify the following arguments to control the evaluation process:

- --batch_size: The batch size to use for evaluation
- --data_dir: The directory where the data is stored
To generate audio samples from the model, run the infer.py script with the following command:

```
python infer.py
```

You can specify the following arguments to control the inference process:

- --batch_size: The batch size to use for inference
- --num_samples: The number of audio samples to generate
- --input_text: The input text to use as a condition for the audio generation


# Data
The model is trained on a dataset of chat transcriptions and corresponding audio waveforms. The data can be in any format that is compatible with the WaveNet and ChatGPT models. For example, the transcriptions can be tokenized and encoded as integer sequences, and the waveforms can be represented as NumPy arrays or TensorFlow tensors.

To train the model, you will need to prepare the data and split it into training, validation, and test sets. You can use the tf.data API to create a dataset object that iterates over the data and applies any necessary preprocessing and augmentation.

# Training
To train the model, you will need to define a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function should measure the difference between the model's output and the ground truth data, and the optimizer should update the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

You can use the tf.keras.Model.compile() method to configure the model for training, and the tf.keras.Model.fit() method to train the model on the training data. The fit() method will iterate over the training data, compute the loss and gradients, and update the model's parameters using the optimizer.

# Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance, you can use the tf.keras.Model.evaluate() method to compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on the validation or test data. You can also use the tf.keras.Model.predict() method to generate audio samples from the model and compare them to the ground truth data.
